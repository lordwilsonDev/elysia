# ðŸ§± META SYSTEMS BUILDER: System Blueprint

## Overview
- Purpose: Triple-redundant, self-auditing build system
- Scale: 2 â†’ 10 concurrent users
- Core Principle: "Assume failure. Design around it. Eliminate it."

## Architecture
The system implements a three-layer architecture:

1. **Genesis Build**: Triple-redundant build system with fallback strategies
2. **Inversion Audit**: Proactive failure testing and resilience scoring
3. **Autonomous Deployment**: Self-documenting deployment to GitHub

## Key Components
- `core_engine.py`: Main orchestrator
- `build_layer1.py`: Triple build strategies
- `audit_layer2.py`: Inversion testing engine
- `deploy_layer3.py`: Autonomous deployment system

## Success Criteria
- âœ… At least one build strategy succeeds
- âœ… Resilience score â‰¥ 8.0/10
- âœ… Autonomous deployment to GitHub
- âœ… releases.md updated with cognitive release notes
